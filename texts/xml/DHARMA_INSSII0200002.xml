						<summary><!--This is the programmatic inscription of the Rājarājeśvara temple founded by Rājarāja I Cōḻa. It contains in its first part the royal order of the 20th day of his 26th regnal year, reported in the first person plural, enjoining that the donations by the king Rājarāja, his elder sister, his wives and other donors to Rājarājeśvara be engraved on the temple (<foreign>vimāna</foreign>). Then is a list of various items donated by Rājarāja, from the 312th day of his 25th regnal year up to the 319th day of his 26th regnal year. The second part provides a further list of items donated by Rājarāja between his 23rd and 29th regnal years. The donated items are mostly gold utensils and ornaments. Besides such items, noteworthy are the donation of golden images of Koḷkaideva (Hultzsch's §3) and Kṣetrapāladeva (Hultzsch's §33; the attributes of the deity are mentioned), the gilding of the temple pinnacle with copper and gold (Hultzsch's §18). The inscription explicitly states that the stone-temple (<foreign>tirukkaṟṟaḷi</foreign>) of Rājarājeśvara (<foreign>rājarājīśvaram uṭaiyār</foreign>, literally "the lord of [the <foreign>liṅga</foreign> named] Rājarājeśvara ("the lord of Rājarāja")) was founded by Rājarāja (line 1.6=6) and that the first part of the inscription is engraved on the <foreign>jagatippaṭai</foreign> of the temple (Hultzsch's §51).--></summary>

		<list>
			<item>§§1-50, with the programmatic order of the 20th day of the 26th regnal year Rājarāja I Cōḻa (§1) and the list of the donations the king himself made from the 312th day of his 25th regnal year up to the 319th day of his 26th regnal year, constitutes the first part.</item>
			<item>§§ 51-107, with the list of further donations the king himself made between his 23rd and 29th regnal years, constitutes the second part.</item></list>
	</p>
	<p>The exact date of the record and the status of both parts is unclear. According <bibl><ptr target="bib:Hultzsch1891_01"/></bibl> (p. 1), <quote>[t]he last set of paragraphs (51 to 107) was incised at a later date than the preceding part of the inscription, to which it refers as previously engraved (paragraph 51).</quote> It is possible, but has to be checked on the stone at the transition between both parts, that the entire inscription was engraved only in the 29th regnal year of Rājarāja.</p>
	
	<p>
		The initial stanza (a Sanskrit <foreign>anuṣṭubh</foreign>) is similar to those found on the seals of copper-plate grants of other Cōḻa kings.
